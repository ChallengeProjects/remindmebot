Hello there, lets walk you through what you can do in the bot, will only take 53 seconds
set your timezone using /timezone (example: ...)
try to set this reminder: /remindme in 20m to whatever
now if you dont have time to type the whole "remindme" you can just type "/r"
<next msg after 1 second> "lets try this, type /r tomorrow  at 5 pm to ..."
"/r on the 3rd of march to ..."
"now if you dont want to be reminded of any of these stuff, type in /list and delete them"
"nice now you know how to do all of these things, for more ways to set reminders, you can check /help or /help_with_recurring_reminders"
