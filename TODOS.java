TODOS:
----------------------
[Sorted By Priority]
* parseRecurringDates unit tests are not checking for endingConditionDate because it needs chrono
* unit tests for _getDateTextFromOrdinal, both cases
    * add unit test for processTime for 23rd of march
* 3:36 reminder -> getDateFormatted in remidnerdate.js outputs the next reminder date instead of the recurringDates.nextReminderDate. what else has this problem?
* specific error msg: u need to use am and pm if they entered number > 12
* suggest autofix text before time
    * send message "Did you mean?", with "Yes", "No" buttons
    * save reminder in user temp storage, "Yes" button will 
* [1 hour] remindme every 2 saturdays OR every 2 weeks starting saturday
* [1 hour] remindme every 1st of month
    * note: you also need to process ordinal strings like "first"
------------------
* unit tests for english and italian for parseSingleNonRecurringDate ["tra 10 minuti" ,"tra 1 ora" ,"tra tre minuti" ,"alle 10" ,"il 23 di Marzo" ,"alle 2 di pomeriggio" ,"domani alle 5 di pomeriggio" ,"tra 5 minuti" ,"mercoledÃ¬" ,"il 5 Gennaio"]
* Italian:
    * choose language from the beginning to show the right welcome message
    * timezone help message in italian
    * bot needs to reply in italian too
* make a specific help message for the bot when its a group chat to clarify that the user doesnt need to run the command /list@chemistrybot instead just do /list
    * can the bot detect when it has been added to the group and send a message automatically?
* auto search preset reminders
    * user types "@bot snug" and bot will display command: "/r charge snugphones at 8 pm"
    * user taps, bam, reminder set
* better way to output recurring reminders
* list inline query typeahead search
* remind me on tuesdayS and wednesdayS at .. to ...
* remind me first weekend after 04/17 to ..
    * remind me on the weekend in 2 weeks to..
* clean up the mess i made from the server commit, the response function should be abstracted
    * one function to respond to bot
    * one function to respond to alfred
    * every bot -> callback should be split to bot -> callback that calls another callback, the wrapper callback would pass the correct reply function
* use this to reply to my own message when user snoozes: ctx.reply(message, extra.inReplyTo(message.message_id))
    * Need to store my own message_id somewhere first: https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf/issues/154
* attach images to reminders
* sed command to edit texts
* Delete -> undo
--------
LOW PRIORITY:
* [1 hour] add random reminder /remindme every [3-7] hours
    * random flag and parameters (i guess range in this case)
    * callback function that sends the message generates the next one based on the range
* plot a graph of all reminders times
* remind me tomorrow at 3 pm and every tuesday at 4 pm to ... [mix recurring and non recurring reminders]
* dashboard:
    * parse the log file and draw charts for how often people are:
        * setting reminders (non recurring vs recurring)
        * setting invalid reminders
        * /start
    * setup autorotation for the log file so it doesnt max out
UX DESIGN PROBLEMS:
    * autocorrect on list search
    * /remindme to.. at..
    * /remindme to..
        * when do you want to be reminded?
* only allow admin to use reminder bot in a group
* bot said i dont have any reminders, if i dont have any it should show the recurring ones
    * or think of a better way in general to list them all, what if i only had a couple of non recurring reminders
        * then I can either show the recurring ones in the same message or in a different one?
* setup server instead of polling for bot so its faster (add an option in config to do that)
* [1 hour] alfred workflow for list reminder bot
    * list all when user does typeahead search
    * selection allows user to
        * view the whole text
        * edit time
        * edit text
        * append
* [1 hour] reminder list
    - how to make a list reminder:
    - when shown/edited, show these options
        - add
        - remove
        - clear
        - change title
* pagination: show << page 1,2,3,4,5 >>
* option to edit time for recurring reminders
* /rate goes to storebot
* donate
-----
big effort:
* mac app for remindmebot
* sync events with google/ios calendar
    Add reminders as events to the calendar
        * new command /schedule to add an event
    remind me when im free:
        check couple of hours gap in the calendar?
    remind me when im at a place
        * when im home? see when i finished work
        * when im in sunnyvale? find events that are in sunnyvale
    * on the same day it would ask me if i want to delay my reminders after my calendar events, and by how long
* messenger bot
-----
non features:
* unit tests
    * setTimeout reminders
* move the edit stuff in another module, refactor everything
* middleware that runs before every call to check if user exists, if not it creates it
* docker for the whole thing
* install redis or memcached
-----
list - list all reminders
remindme - add a reminder
timezone - set your timezone
help - how to use this bot
about - about this bot
-----------------------------------
Alfred workflow:
    First time Alfred:
        Ask to write username
        Send to bot the username
        
    Bot send to telegram token
    Alfred asks for token
    Alfred sends bot token and confirms that its correct
    Bot gets new token from telegram to encrypt all messages
    -----
    Alfred sends /remind me to bot, gets confirmation or error message from bot and displays it
    -------
    Alfred sends /list
    Lists inline
    Choose to view then u get the option to edit
